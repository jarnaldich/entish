Description
===========

A racket library / DSL for creating, checking and removing directory
trees. The idea is to have a s-expression based DSL in which the
nesting level in a s-expression parallels the nesting level in a
directory structure, so that it is easy to see the directory tree
that is to be created/checked/removed.

Still very rough: it fits my needs, but I am flexible to change
anything.
